# AuswaertsSpiel - Azure Static Web App
This is another try after the Flask one, let's try out the Azure static web apps.

I didn't want to use VS Code, so I went directly to the portal and selected
Azure Static Web App.

I added a new resource group.

Azure Static Web Apps seem to be available closest in West Europe, so we go with that.

I logged in with GitHub. I selected the repository, and used the main branch.


## Integrations
The UI is still quite simplistic, so I'm considering whether I want to continue
going down this route. No matter though, first thing is to get the traces somewhere: https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2020-08-12-getting-logs-from-static-web-apps-apis/
